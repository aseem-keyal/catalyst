<p>It’s your first day of kindergarten. You walk into your new classroom. Your teacher says hello. On the agenda for the day: art class in the morning followed by math class in the afternoon. Art class begins – the teacher distributes neon paint and crisp sheets of blank white paper, giving you the green light to paint whatever your little heart desires. Maybe you paint your house, maybe you paint your family, but after an hour, no matter what you choose to paint, you have a masterpiece that you know will be proudly displayed on the refrigerator at home. Now, math class begins – the teacher distributes newly sharpened No. 2 pencils and worksheets stamped with the math problems for the day. You focus, you think really hard and you write down your answers. The teacher grades your worksheet. 70%. Uh oh, mom and dad aren’t going to like this…I wish we didn’t have math class and just had art class all day.

STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is becoming a greater focus around the world as people begin to recognize the potential impact of STEM advancements in our everyday lives, from improving healthcare to creating new technology. However, STEM fields are struggling to attract the interest of students today and we believe a portion of this can be attributed to our current education system. It is not that math and science are inherently less interesting than other subjects, but rather that our education system is just currently not well- equipped to teach math and science in a more impactful and effective way to our younger generations. Paint is not dangerous, chemicals are. Coloring is fun, practicing multiplication tables is not. That isn’t to say being an artist isn’t tough – to be an expert in any field requires hard work and dedication, but why is it that we allow art to at least start off being fun and intriguing while we force math and science to start out being terribly boring and dry? What might happen if we could make math and science fun too? Can we do it?
<br>
<br>
We would like to try. Beginning with chemistry, we will do our best to make STEM education fun. The premise of our program focuses around the concept of a magic show, where the members of our organization use basic chemical reactions to create an entire production that will introduce young students to the more captivating and exciting part of science. We plan to reach out to local elementary schools, with particular focus on underprivileged schools, to set up shows. However, we are also aware that without continuing support and guidance, a single magic show will likely not lead to a long-term increase in the number of students who choose to pursue STEM careers. To that extent, we plan to start school programs as a second component of our program. In coordination with full-time teachers at these elementary schools, we will provide regular assistance to help students carry out activities that allow students to try hands on experiments and labs.
<br>
<br>
Eventually, we would like to further expand our program to include schools across the country and potentially construct a similar program for older students in middle school or high school.</p>
